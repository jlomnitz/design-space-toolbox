Design Space Toolbox V2 (C Library)
==============================================

The Design Space Toolbox V2 is a library for analysis of mechanistic models of biochemical systems.  This library automates the difficult steps within the System Design Space Approach by combining symbolic and numerical methods for the analysis of systems composed of ordinary differential equations.

The library includes a computer algebra system for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions and numerical methods for the analysis and visualization of model behaviors.  Examples of the Design Space Toolbox V2 through the Python are available at the projects website [here](https://jlomnitz.github.io/design-space-toolbox).


Getting Started
---------------------



The preferred installation process is using the Design Space Toolbox V2 update and installation script (see https://bitbucket.org/jglomnitz/toolbox-update-script for detailed instructions). This script manages the Git repositories associated with the C Library, Python Interface, as well as a modified version of the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) library used by the Design Space Toolbox Project.

This is part of the Design Space Toolbox V2 project, a software implementation of the System Design Space method developed by Jason G. Lomnitz, originally developed in the laboratory of Michael A. Savageau (for examples of this methodology, see [1-6]). This method decomposes complex nonlinear systems into a finite number of tractable nonlinear subsystems.
