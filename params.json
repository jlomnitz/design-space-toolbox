All rights reserved.\r\nE-mail: <jlomn@ucdavis.edu>.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the Design Space Toolbox V2 project, a software implementation of the System Design Space method developed by Jason G. Lomnitz, originally developed in the laboratory of Michael A. Savageau (for examples of this methodology, see [1-6]). This method decomposes complex nonlinear systems into a finite number of tractable nonlinear subsystems.\r\n\r\nThe Design Space Toolbox V2 C Library is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preferred installation process is using the Design Space Toolbox V2 update and installation script (see https://bitbucket.org/jglomnitz/toolbox-update-script for detailed instructions). This script manages the Git repositories associated with the C Library, Python Interface, as well as a modified version of the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) library used by the Design Space Toolbox Project.\r\n\r\n\r\nTutorials\r\n---------\r\n\r\n[Example of the Design Space Toolbox V2 IPython Notebook](workshop_index.html)\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n1.
