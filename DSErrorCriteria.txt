CRITERIA for A_DS_WARNING
* A_DS_WARNING is used to indicate a situation where there is ambiguous data.
* In these situations, normal operation can resume despite the ambiguous data.
* An example of a A_DS_WARNING is passing a NULL DSMatrix to substract to
* another DSMatrix. A NULL pointer in this situation represents the Zero matrix;
* however, the Zero matrix should be used explicitly.

CRITERIA for A_DS_ERROR
* A_DS_ERROR is used to indicate a situation in which data is clearly missing,
* erroneous or of the wrong type; thus, normal operation of the program cannot
* resume.  In this situation, the error is posted and function calls finish
* gracefully, returning neutral values such as NULL pointers. An example of a
* A_DS_ERROR is when trying to access an element of a matrix beyond its bounds.


CRITERIA for A_DS_FATAL
* A_DS_FATAL represents an error presenting a situation from which it cannot be
* recovered, reflecting the most critical of errors, such as unable to allocate
* more memory.
